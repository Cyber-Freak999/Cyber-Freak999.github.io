<h3> RITSEC CTF '23 </h3>

### I had fun while playing this ctf and learnt new things ðŸ˜„. Lets get straight to the fun

### Intro

If you just go to the discord channel and check the rules you will see the flag

```
Flag: RS{!flag}
```

<h3> Chandi Bot </h3>

### Chandi Bot 1

After going to the discord channel there's a bot there called chandi checking its profile gives the flag
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229284828-e4d99d9c-193e-47e1-910f-a41147089416.png)

```
Flag: RS{QUANTUM_RESISTANT_ENCRYPTION}
```

### Chandi Bot 2

Trying the functions of the bot shows this

Now we can get the flag by doing /flag
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229284979-b4b1da0e-f978-4098-b30b-5d372a149e2f.png)

```
Flag: RS{HMMM_WHAT_ARE_YOU_LOOKING_AT}
```

### Chandi Bot 4
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229289993-89a9938f-bbc1-433f-ae29-e249f5720e11.png)

The bot has a rock paper scissors game (rps)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229290099-7385d53d-66ba-410f-92cd-bc760ee01012.png)

There's also a buy flag but it requires 10000 points
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229290203-8a753069-086e-4b8d-b49f-fb7894a5af98.png)

And the way to get point is by getting a dad joke from /dad and playing rps with staking the point you have

But the dad joke just gives one point
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229290374-7a2cec85-f7eb-4f27-8b42-eeffa0bd63e3.png)

I currently have 160 points but normally its supposed to be just 1 point 

From now we can play the rps game

But chances of winning is very low tho 

After playing and loosing we get this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229291964-ec05f126-aad7-455e-bb11-f885833da5bb.png)

Checking the balance shows it reduces by the amount stacked
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229292005-abc29369-5255-4277-95ac-e8a5939393e2.png)

So the idea is that it does

```
if botwins:
  balance = balance - stake
```

Now it subtracts its initial balance with the amount staked

But what if we stake negative number yunno what happens ðŸ™‚

```
if botwins:
  balance = balance - (-stake)
```

It will turn to a positive number making the balance increase

Trying my assumption works

Now we can get the flag
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229292440-b514d16f-30be-4895-b4f4-ad684458e92c.png)

```
Flag: RS{TWO_NEGATIVES_DO_MAKE_A_POSITIVE}
```

### Chandi Bot 5

This part just asks series of question and if its up to 10 and you get it right then the bot gives you the flag
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229292703-8e173825-1fe2-4133-adbc-6b6c1557cb06.png)

After playing with it i gathered that some question asked are 

```

What is RITSEC's main website? = ritsec.club
What is the name of the RITSEC Current Discord Bot?  = 0Bii

On heading to the web server it shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229299527-a34b4c10-5943-4910-ac4a-03f09808ca91.png)

Trying to put any output shows that it echos the output back
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229299564-4a9d887e-6559-41f8-8e54-ab587d066a6e.png)

What i then taught from the challenge name is that it runs like echo command on our input

So i tried command injection using `whoami` and it works
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229299615-4f392af2-c9fe-410a-813a-588569fff434.png)

Next i checked for if the flag is in the current directory
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229299635-141223e4-59bd-4eea-bb12-683128959af0.png)

From here we can get the flag
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229299659-4d310a0b-c090-4c06-80f6-e6651cea6247.png)

Checking the web server shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229299749-748b56df-16ae-4731-9f84-ebcc5956be75.png)

Nothing there is really there most links there are just going to get you rick rolled

But this links source code:

```
https://rickroll-web.challenges.ctf.ritsec.club/1.html
https://rickroll-web.challenges.ctf.ritsec.club/2.css
https://rickroll-web.challenges.ctf.ritsec.club/Don't.html
```

Gives the flag:

```
[RS{/\/eveRG0nna_]
[_|3tY0|_|d0vvn]
[_TuRna30unD_]
[_D3s3RTy0u}]
[G1v3y0uuP]
```

Then after i arranged it, i got the flag as:

```
Flag: RS{/\/eveRG0nna_G1v3y0uuP_|3tY0|_|d0vvn_TuRna30unD_D3s3RTy0u}

Checking the web server shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229301544-f14c07ba-b53f-432b-b51a-0ec06dc000a6.png)

Clicking on any of the names down and intercepting the request in burp suite shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229301783-f80eff00-8fe8-479e-bdc0-46a2b7b4c754.png)

Some base64 encoded value is stored in the cookie 

Decoding it gives this

```
âžœ  ~ python3
Python 3.11.1 (main, Dec 31 2022, 10:23:59) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a='PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4wJyBlbmNvZGluZz0nVVRGLTgnPz48aW5wdXQ+PHhtZW4+QmVhc3Q8L3htZW4+PC9pbnB1dD4='
>>> import base64
>>> print(base64.b64decode(a))
b"<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><input><xmen>Beast</xmen></input>"
>>> 
```

So its encoding the it in an xml format and sending to the server then the server decodes the encoded blob then execute it

This is xxe ðŸ™‚

I then created a script to help me enumerate files on the server via the xxe [Req](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/ritsec/web/xmen/solve.py)

Running it on and fetching `/etc/passwd` works

Now this part took me quite a while cause i was looking for the wrong file ðŸ˜…

Well after my stress i found the file to be at /flag

Reading it works

This is quite very easy lets get to it

After downloading the binary i ran strings on it and got the flag

```
âžœ  ~ strings meow.exe | grep RS{
RS{C4tsL1keStr1ng5}
âžœ  ~ 
```

```
Flag: RS{C4tsL1keStr1ng5}
```

After downloading the binary i'll check its file type and the protections enabled on it
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229309369-3791e617-8035-430b-ae78-e59d2df4c66a.png)

From here we can see the we're working with a x64 binary and no protections are enabled on it which is a good thing ðŸ™‚

Next i'll run the binary to get an overview of what it does
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229309426-ccea1d4c-d8b1-440e-8b91-5547090c050f.png)

It just prints out some words receives our input and prints out another word

Using ghidra i'll decompile the binary and view the main function
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229309898-18d25320-2272-4a39-8899-4b5ba6d14ceb.png)

The main function just calls the user_input() function

Here's the decompiled user_input() function
