If you just go to the discord channel and check the rules you will see the flag

After going to the discord channel there's a bot there called chandi checking its profile gives the flag

```

Trying the functions of the bot shows this

Now we can get the flag by doing /flag

```
Flag: RS{HMMM_WHAT_ARE_YOU_LOOKING_AT}
```

### Chandi Bot 4

The bot has a rock paper scissors game (rps)

There's also a buy flag but it requires 10000 points
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229290203-8a753069-086e-4b8d-b49f-fb7894a5af98.png)

And the way to get point is by getting a dad joke from /dad and playing rps with staking the point you have

But the dad joke just gives one point
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229290374-7a2cec85-f7eb-4f27-8b42-eeffa0bd63e3.png)

I currently have 160 points but normally its supposed to be just 1 point 

From now we can play the rps game

But chances of winning is very low tho 

After playing and loosing we get this

Checking the balance shows it reduces by the amount stacked
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/229292005-abc29369-5255-4277-95ac-e8a5939393e2.png)

So the idea is that it does

```
if botwins:
  balance = balance - stake
```

Now it subtracts its initial balance with the amount staked

But what if we stake negative number yunno what happens ðŸ™‚

```
if botwins:
  balance = balance - (-stake)
```

It will turn to a positive number making the balance increase

Trying my assumption works

Now we can get the flag
