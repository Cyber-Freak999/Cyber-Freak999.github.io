# Sanity Check

#### Discord

After joining their discord channel I got this

We can tell its base64 so i scripted it in python in order to decoded it

Here's my [script](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/Cyberstarters23/Qualif/Sanity_Check/Discord/solve.py) 

Running it gives the flag

```
Flag: DoHCTF{try_to_be_hacktive_on_discord_hehehehehehe}
```

#### DoHCTF{_colwSPs:(}

Looking at it we can tell its the flag already :D

```
Flag: DoHCTF{_colwSPs:(}
```

#### Twitter 

After clicking on the [link](https://twitter.com/DiaryOfHackers) it redirects me to their twitter page

So i just clicked follow and then back on the ctf I inputted `Yes`
 
```
Flag: Yes
```

# Steg

#### 0K 

We're given a text file to download:

Looking at it we can tell that there's lot of space in the file 

Also using `xxd` we can verify that

Based on this we can tell its SnowSteg that's used

Using `stegsnow` I got the values of those white spaces decoded

```
Flag: DoHCTF{another_quite_simple_one}
```

# OSINT

#### Rogue Agent

This was quite a very fun one i would say (i'm not really an osint person)

We are given this number `+2348109439442` and a third name `Mustapha` 

The task is to find his real linkedln account 

This was nearly almost impossible cause there wasn't any avaialble open source tool on the internet that gets a linkedln user account based on phone number

And attempting to search it manually was futile

Then after a while i remembered that a phone number was given! So the question is what can I do with it ðŸ¤”
