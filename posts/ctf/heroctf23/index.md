#### Math Trap

Since we're given a remote service to connect to let us see what it does

Connecting to it shows this

We're asked a calculation 

I used gave it the answer and got this

I got *Too Slow* so basically we need to solve each math it gives

And doing this manually is not possible cause it also checks the answer received with time

The way forward is by scripting it and that's what I did

Here's my solve [script](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/heroctf/prog/Math%20Trap/solve_2.py) it's not really well scripted but it does the job ðŸ˜„

Running it gives the flag
