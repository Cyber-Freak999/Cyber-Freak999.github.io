First things first, scan the network to discover live host


```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
```

Running our nmap scan we discovered 3 open ports


```bash

Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have this meme ðŸ˜‚ (I hope this teaches people out there not to store password in `.TXT` files, Use a Password Manager instead!!)

Viewing **Page-Source** we have this comments

As usual we can go ahead and add this to our `/etc/hosts` file


![](https://i.imgur.com/wQEJO11.png)



since port `53/DNS` is opened we can go ahead and do a zone transfer attack


![](https://i.imgur.com/GYUn7db.png)

Hell yeah, something looks odd here though, in the `TXT` records we have the text `Myhiddenpazzword` and then it is linked to the subdomain **john.webmaster.hmv**, let go ahead and try to login via SSH with this


![](https://i.imgur.com/UXQYT4S.png)


So definitely **John's** password is `Myhiddenpazzword`, Running `sudo -l` we have permissions to run `nginx` as root using the **sudo** command


![](https://i.imgur.com/hOKh8WH.png)



We can go ahead and host our `/` directory via nginx then get the root flag as i won't be escalating privileges to root, but performing an horizontal privilege escalation, Save the file below on **John's** home folder and call it `whatever.conf`


```
user root;
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
http {
    server {
        listen 1337;
        root /;
        autoindex on;
    }
}
```



Now run `nginx` with **sudo** pointing to the config file as this we host the `/` directory on our localhost running on port `1337`


```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/nginx -c /home/john/whatever.conf 
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/kpsMSvj.png)



The server does not seem to have `curl` installed but it does have `wget`, so we can use `wget` to download the root flag

```bash
wget  127.0.0.1:1337/root/root.txt
```
