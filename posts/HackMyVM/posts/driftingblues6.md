As usual we run our network discovery scan, discovered `192.168.0.115`

Running our nmap scan we discovered only one port


```bash
# Nmap 7.94 scan initiated Fri Nov 17 03:02:13 2023 as: nmap -p- -sVC -v --min-rate=1000 -T4 -oN nmap.txt 192.168.0.115

Checking out port `80/HTTP` we have this website, Nothing really ü§™

Checking out `/robots.txt` just as nmap as said we have this

Navigating to `/textpattern/txtpattern` we have this login page

As said earlier i decided to run a directory bruteforce with `ffuf` adding the `.zip` extension


![](https://i.imgur.com/Kuvl2Gx.png)



We can then download the zip file directly using the command below



```bash
$ wget 192.168.0.115/spammer.zip
```



When we try to unzip the file, we are asked for a password

Using a tool called `fcrackzip` we can go ahead and bruteforce the zip file


```bash
$ sudo apt install fcrackzip
$ fcrackzip -v -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt spammer.zip
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/5nXdEHA.png)



We can go ahead and unzip the archive, which gives us `creds.txt`


![](https://i.imgur.com/U4h63Tr.png)


We can go ahead and login to the login page we found earlier


![](https://i.imgur.com/419HKOE.png)



Navigating to the **content** tab and clicking **Files** we where able to upload a PHP web shell



![](https://i.imgur.com/DqDBUKG.png)


Our PHP web shell was uploaded to `/textpattern/files` called `good.php`, you can find one from www.revshells.com


![](https://i.imgur.com/C40LrEu.png)


Hell yeah, we got reverse shell as user **www-data** (**Hint -:** Use a python payload for stable shell)


![](https://i.imgur.com/h5Gi1fr.png)


Enumerated the box, looking for users, only **www-data** exists, password in config files, SUID, Nothing !!! But running `uname -a` tells us the version of linux we are currently running on -:

Unfortunately, this version of linux is vulnerable to the [Dirty cow](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40616) # Race Condition Privilege Escalation exploit, this will be beneficial to us üòÅ


![](https://i.imgur.com/mM5atFa.png)


Go ahead and copy the code, then create a file name `cowroot.c` and save the file


![](https://i.imgur.com/B7XWtmh.png)



Compile the code using `GCC` with the following command


```bash
$ gcc cowroot.c -o cowroot -pthread
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/eNC4HMx.png)


Now run the code with `./cowroot` and you should be user **root**
