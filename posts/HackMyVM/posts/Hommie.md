Running our ARP scan to detect live host we have a target

Running our nmap scan we have -:


```bash

Logging in to `FTP` as the **anonymous** user looks like we have a directory called `.web`

I noticed in this directory we can upload files from our local machine using the `PUT` command

I was able to upload my `nmap.txt` scan file to the server, Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have this -:

Nothing much in page source, but navigating to `/nmap.txt` we have this -:

Nice, our nmap scan result, we can therefore upload our PHP reverse shell, go ahead and use you favourite payload

- start up a listener `nc -lvnp 4444`
- then copy [this](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) to a file called `shell.shtml`
- make sure to change your `$ip`, use the `ifconfig` command to check

Now we can `cd` to the .web directory and upload our shell

![](https://i.imgur.com/Flc1kZP.png)

Navigating to the directory on the wbesite, it either our shell got downloaded back or can't execute commands, Trust me i tried out different webshells, After series of enumeration i peaked on [@muzec](https://twitter.com/muzecsec) writeup and saw that i need to run a UDP scan

Nice, since `tftp` is a protocol that doesn't require authentication we can connect and try to download the `id_rsa` file


![](https://i.imgur.com/GpUeC64.png)

we now have the `id_rsa` file, let go ahead and connect using `SSH` with the username **alexia** we found

![](https://i.imgur.com/NOO0jNj.png)


After several navigation i found a file in `/opt` directory called **showMetheKey**


![](https://i.imgur.com/LLXUgj6.png)

also running `find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null` points to the file as a `SUID` executable

![](https://i.imgur.com/TvaTPSl.png)

Running this `showMetheKey` file it looks like it provides user **alexia** `id_rsa` key

![](https://i.imgur.com/uEptaxX.png)

Using the `strings` command on the file looks like it checks for the `id_rsa` file from the **HOME** variable

![](https://i.imgur.com/A5r5Bil.png)

We can therefore change the **HOME** variable to `/root` so instead of looking up user **alexia** home directory for `id_rsa`, it looks up the user **root** home directory for it


![](https://i.imgur.com/oYAPHZ9.png)


run the **showMetheKey** SUID executable and you should have the root `id_rsa`


![](https://i.imgur.com/ROuX4Xb.png)


- copy the key content
- cd to `/tmp`
- save into a file
- chmod 600 `filename`
- ssh -i `filename` root@IP

Now you should be root ðŸ¥³
