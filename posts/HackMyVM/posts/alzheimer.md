## **Difficulty = Easy**

First things first, discover live host using `arp-scan`

running our nmap scan we have 

```bash
# Nmap 7.94 scan initiated Sat Oct 28 01:29:07 2023 as: nmap -p- -sCV -T4 -v --min-rate=1000 -oN nmap.txt 192.168.0.103

Connecting to `FTP` via the anonymous user we have a `.secretnote.txt` file

Transfer using the `mget` command

We have a note that talks about port knocking


![](https://i.imgur.com/2CLUpqj.png)

Go ahead and do this

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install knockd
$ knock 192.168.0.103 1000 2000 3000 -v -d 1000
```

Port knocking takes time sometimes so you will have to perform the previous command multiple times

After more attempts all filtered ports are now opened

Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have this note

Performing dir/file bruteforce with `ffuf` we have

![](https://i.imgur.com/l0ok1Gp.png)


`/admin` gives us a 404 but `/home` gives us this


![](https://i.imgur.com/IiQtbVW.png)


`/secret` then gives us this

Fuzzing again this time with `/secret` using `ffuf` we have

![](https://i.imgur.com/NXtO56K.png)


Navigating to `/secret/home` we have this


![](https://i.imgur.com/1i4GSGi.png)



fuzzed for parameters, checked file source, tried bruteforcing, Nothing !!!, checking few write-ups i found out we where meant to get the password from the `.secretnote.txt` file

I don't think the box is broken, let move, logged in with the `SSH` credentials as user **medusa:ihavebeenalwayshere!!!**

Running `sudo -l` we have permissions to `/bin/id` with sudo privileges

![](https://i.imgur.com/h9fOAOC.png)

It seems like i couldn't get privilege escalation with **sudo**, running `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null` we can see we have permissions to run **capsh** with `SUID`


![](https://i.imgur.com/tntqCdH.png)


Checking [gtfobins]() we can get user **root** with `capsh`

Running the payload we are user **root**
