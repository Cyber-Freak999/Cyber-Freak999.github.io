# Discovering vulnerabilities quickly with targeted scanning

---
---

We are given a website to discover a vulnerability that enables us to read arbitrary files from the server. To solve the lab, we have to retrieve the contents ofÂ `/etc/passwd`Â within 10 minutes.

Clicking **View details** >> **Check stock** then intercepting the request with burp gives us different endpoint we could test

I tried out different `Local File Inclusion` Payloads but none seems to work, even tried fuzzing with different payloads but for every result, i get a random number ðŸ˜…

Since the topic focuses on discovering Vulnerabilities, i decided to scan this page using **Burpsuite Professional** , Navigate to the **Target** tab and look for the Site under the **Contents** tab

Right click on the **Contents** tab and click **scan**

You should be referred to a New window like this, Just confirm the website URL and click `OK` at the bottom of this window if everything is checked

The next tab under the **Contents** tab where we have `Requests` and `Response`, **Right-click** and click `send to repeater`

Navigate to the `Repeater` tab and click `send` then go back to the **Target** tab and you should see additional vulnerabilities (Issues)

If you can't see additional vulnerabilities, Navigate to the dashboard and under **Tasks** click the small arrow icon to see more <....>

You should now get a new tab, Navigate to **issue activity** to see all potential Vulnerabilities

Now that we have discovered all this vulnerabilities, you can check them one by one, But the vulnerability here is `Out of-band resource load (HTTP)` , we can exploit this by checking the request and seeing what payload burp used

We have got an XXE injection going on here, using this exact payload we can retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file from the server

```xml
<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
```

Note that If your time is up just click restart and things should go on fine

Navigate to the **Repeater** tab and input this payload in the `productID` parameter

That will be all for today ðŸ¥³
