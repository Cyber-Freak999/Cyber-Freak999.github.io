# Changing MAC Address in Linux

Changing your MAC address in Linux can be useful for various reasons, such as enhancing privacy, bypassing MAC address-based restrictions, or troubleshooting network connectivity issues. In this blog post, we will explore the manual process of changing the MAC address in Linux and introduce a custom tool that automates the process.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:

- Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS)
- Administrative privileges or sudo access

## Manual Process to Change MAC Address

To change the MAC address manually in Linux, follow these steps:

1. Identify the network interface you want to modify:

   Run the following command to list the available network interfaces:

   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   
   Look for the interface name (e.g., eth0, wlan0) that you want to change the MAC address for.

- Disable the network interface:
Run the following command to disable the interface:

```bash
sudo ifconfig <interface> down
```
Replace <interface> with the actual interface name.

- Change the MAC address:
Use the following command to set a new MAC address for the interface:

```bash
sudo ifconfig <interface> hw ether <new_mac_address>
```
Replace <interface> with the actual interface name and <new_mac_address> with the new MAC address you want to set. Ensure the MAC address is in the format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.

- Enable the network interface:
Run the following command to enable the interface again:

```bash
sudo ifconfig <interface> up
```
Replace <interface> with the actual interface name.

- Verify the MAC address change:
Run the following command to confirm that the MAC address has been changed:

```bash
ifconfig <interface>
```

# Introducing MY Custom MAC Changer Tool
