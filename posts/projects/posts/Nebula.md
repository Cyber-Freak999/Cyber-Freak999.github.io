## Embarking on My Nebula Challenge: Unveiling Linux Vulnerabilities

If you're as passionate as I am about delving into the intricate world of cybersecurity and exploit development, Nebula offers an exciting path to enhance our skills. Nebula, a captivating exploit development challenge, guides participants through a diverse array of both commonplace and uncommon vulnerabilities found in Linux systems. This immersive journey takes us deep into the heart of Linux security, providing hands-on experience with a wide range of topics.

## Unveiling Linux Weaknesses

Nebula doesn't hold back in exploring critical areas of vulnerability within Linux environments. By immersing us in real-world scenarios, it uncovers the following topics:

- SUID files
- Permissions
- Race conditions
- Shell meta-variables
- $PATH weaknesses
- Scripting language vulnerabilities
- Binary compilation failures

## A Personalized Learning Experience

As we progress through Nebula, we gain a comprehensive understanding of local attack vectors against Linux systems. From tackling common weaknesses to navigating the intricacies of privilege escalation, Nebula equips us with the knowledge and skills needed to secure Linux systems effectively.

## My Nebula Journey

Getting started is simple:

1. Explore the levels available in the sidebar.
2. Log into the virtual machine using the username `levelXX` and the password `levelXX` (without quotes), where XX corresponds to the level number. Some levels can be completed remotely.

### Taking Command with Root Access

If we find ourselves needing root access to make modifications, follow these steps:

1. Log in as the "nebula" user with the password "nebula" (both without quotes).
2. Use the command `sudo -s` with the password "nebula" to gain root privileges, empowering us to make necessary changes.

## Crafting a Walkthrough

I'm excited to share that I'll be creating an in-depth walkthrough of my Nebula challenge journey right here on my blog. Step by step, I'll detail the strategies, techniques, and solutions that I've discovered along the way. Together, we'll unravel the complexities of Nebula and learn how to navigate its challenges effectively.

At the culmination of my Nebula journey, I'll emerge with a profound grasp of local attack techniques and a glimpse into the realm of remote attacks. Nebula's meticulously designed challenges set the stage for my exhilarating exploration of Linux security vulnerabilities.
