Running our `Nmap` scan gives us this :

```sh

Since Port 80/HTTP is opened, i decided to run a dir/file scan with `ffuf` first :

`ffuf` doesn't seems to be giving me what i want, so let us check the website :

- [ ] The website doesn't seems to be responsive.
- [ ]  `robots.txt` isn't available.
- [ ] No directories ‚ùå No files ‚ùå.

Checking the Technologies gives us little Impression, i mean i hardly see websites with `PHP` versions

Enumerating the PHP version, looks like it is vulnerable to RCE in the `user-agent` :

This [exploit](https://github.com/flast101/php-8.1.0-dev-backdoor-rce/blob/main/revshell_php_8.1.0-dev.py) works best, Now let run it

Which definitely should give you a shell back :

#### Privilege Escalation

- Running `sudo -l` tells us we can run `/usr/bin/knife` with sudo permissions

- Checking `GTFOBINS` we have a payload to escalate privileges using `knife` :

- Then using the payload gives us root, you can tweak the payload to this `sudo knife exec -E 'exec "/bin/bash"'` :
