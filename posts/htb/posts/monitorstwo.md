Checking the web server on port 80 shows an instance of *Cacti Version 1.2.22 *

Searching google for default credentials show that it's *guest:guest*

After attempting to loggin in with it doesn't works

Then since we know the version i searched up google for [exploit](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/cacti_unauthenticated_cmd_injection/) and found this

Well I tried using metasploit for it ðŸ‘€. But for some reason the exploit isn't available on my own version of metasploit I guess i have to save the ruby exploit manually

So I used a github [exploit](https://github.com/FredBrave/CVE-2022-46169-CACTI-1.2.22)

Trying it works

We can tell that this is a docker container

We can stabilize our shell using:

```bash
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
export TERM=xterm
CTRL +Z
stty raw -echo;fg
```

I uploaded linpeas.sh to the box for further enumeration

After runnng the script *bash linpeas.sh* I found this interesting

Using [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/capsh/#suid) shows a way we can escalate priv to root

Trying it gives us root user on the docker container
