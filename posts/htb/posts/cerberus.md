<h3> Cerberus HackTheBox </h3>

### Difficulty = Hard

### IP Address = 10.10.11.205

#### This is my first hard rated hackthebox machine and its a windows box xD

Nmap Scan:

I added the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` file

```
âžœ  ~ cat /etc/hosts | grep cer
10.10.11.205    icinga.cerberus.local cerberus.local
âžœ  ~ 
```

After navigating to the web server I got this login page

Since weak cred doesn't work (lets face it this is an hard htb box ðŸ˜‚) I decided to check for exploits

And i found a path transversal exploit

Here's the resource [Exploit](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/path-traversal-vulnerabilities-in-icinga-web/)

To get the `/etc/passwd` file according to the exploit you goto

```
Vuln: http://icinga.cerberus.local:8080/icingaweb2/lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/etc/passwd
```

Trying that works

And now if you read the resource you will see that authenticated user can then gain RCE via ssh key

First on the normal login page looking at the source code shows this

```
file:///etc/icingaweb2/ssh/nima
```

It shows us the path to the `Icinga Web 2` 

That is useful cause we want to enumerate creds

So i asked chatgpt and got the answer

Trying that works

```
Username: matthew
Password: IcingaWebPassword2023
```

Using that to login works

From here we can get RCE using the same resource that exploited the path transversal

#### Exploitation: Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-24715)

Using this exploit scrpit [Exploit](https://github.com/JacobEbben/CVE-2022-24715/blob/main/exploit.py)

I got shell
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/227747439-4c75a59c-8f97-4b7c-a2c7-59662defba6b.png)

Now this is weird cause cerberus is a windows box and not a linux box 

That means we're in some sort of container ðŸ¤”

Next thing is to get root and checking for suid binary shows this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/227747986-0d824e24-6530-4251-8c57-05c5c6750d8a.png)

```
/usr/bin/firejail
```

So i searched for exploit and found this [Resource](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/08/10)

There's an exploit script for (CVE-2022-31214) [Exploit](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2022/q2/att-188/firejoin_py)

I transferred it to the target and run it, my privilege was escalated to root

After getting root i decided to find a way to escape this container

THen on running linpeas.sh i got this
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/227748494-a022052d-65dd-4081-81e6-570bb807c7a2.png)

Cache Cred is True in this joined domain host

So i asked chatgpt again and it says the path where the cred and information of a windows joined domain host is located at `/var/lib/sss/db`

After checking i saw that `cache_cerberus.local.ldb` has an hash

Then i cracked it and it belongs to user `matthew`
