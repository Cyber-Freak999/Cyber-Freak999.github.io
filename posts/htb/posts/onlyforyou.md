Update your */etc/hosts* file with the content of the domain name *only4you.htb*

Going over to the web server shows this

Using *ffuf* I fuzzed for vhosts

Adding the new vhosts *beta.only4you.htb* to my */etc/hosts* file

Checking the vhost shows this

I downloaded the source code for this web instance

There's a file upload functon but I didn't particularly find it interesting cause it was rather secured to me ðŸ¤”

But here's the vulnerable part of the code

The user can query files for download and there's a prevention against LFI but we can still achieve file inclusion without using *../*

I made a [script](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/htb/b2b/onlyforyou/enumerate.py) to automate finding of files 

We know that the server is hosted on *Nginx* from *Wappalyzer Result*

And the default path for web server (vhost) config running nginx is */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default*

Checking it shows the web path to the vhost which turns out to be */var/www/only4you.htb/ and /var/www/beta.only4you.htb*

Now we can enumerate more files
