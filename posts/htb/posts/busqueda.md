I'll add the domain *searcher.htb* to my */etc/hosts* file

Going over to the web server shows this

So basically this is a server that uses any search engine chosen and returns a query of what the users searches for

Here's a good [resource](https://sethsec.blogspot.com/2016/11/exploiting-python-code-injection-in-web.html) on it 

Getting it to work was a little bit tricky tho cause I had to include '+{payload}+'
