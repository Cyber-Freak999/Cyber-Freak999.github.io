# Template

## Difficulty = Easy

Navigating to the website we get this:

Looks like a website that uses Flask and python

Hmmmmm, something is fishy, let enumerate :

- Using google top searches came out as SSTI (Server side Template Injection)

- Nice, Let test for SSTI vulnerabilities on the website by injecting a simple expression which we expect to be executed/evaluated by the templating engine.
-  To do so, we are using theÂ `{{Â ...Â }}`Â syntax native to Jinja2

- As we can see `7*12 =84`, which is true, This website is vulnerable to SSTI
- let go ahead and exploit it

[Gus Ralph](https://twitter.com/SecGus)Â presents a very clever RCE payload that leverages the fact that Flask/Jinja2 templates have theÂ `request`Â object available to them, you can read more from here [OnSecurity article](https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2/)

- Now let use this payload to see if the **system command** `id` get executed:

```
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}
```

As we can see, it print out the output of the `id` command back to us, we can now replace id and get our flag:

- first of all replace `id` with `ls`

- Now cat out flag.txt with `cat flag.txt`
