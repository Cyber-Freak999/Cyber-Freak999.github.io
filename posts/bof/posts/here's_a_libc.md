<h3> Here's A Libc PicoCTF </h3>

### Binary Exploitation

We're given a binary and a remote libc library

Firstly i'll use pwninit to patch the binary

You can neglect the solve.py file pwninit automatically creates it to use as the pwn script

Anyways the reason i patched the binary is so that it uses the libc file given 

#### Basic File Checks

We're working with a x64 binary and no protection is enabled except NX (No Execute)

I'll run the binary to know what it does

It just goes in a loop and echo our input back

Using ghidra i'll decompile the binary

Here's the decompiled main function

We see that it calls function do_stuff()

Here's the decompiled do_stuff() function

From the high lighted section of the image we see that it uses scanf without specifying the amount of bytes to read causing a buffer overflow

Lets confirm it
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/224202051-4ef70250-3bb8-4e3a-825d-6ba26359d9c8.png)

So the best way to pwn this binary is by performing ROP ret2libc 

During the program execution we see that the GOT of puts is already populated

Now lets get the offset
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/224202610-79f4c063-4449-4479-b6b8-e4aeef8d3b2e.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/224202644-ad1ffa24-81cf-41cf-af35-5c61ee235522.png)

The offset is `136`

To get a `pop rdi & ret` gadget i'll use `ropper`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/224202730-2187c2e1-a373-41bb-9275-e6e7fc8b5da3.png)

The reason am getting a ret gadget is not to encounter movaps stack allignment

So the idea of my exploit (ret2libc) is to use `puts@plt` to write the `puts@got` to `rdi` which will basically print the got puts address to the screen

From there i'll calculate the libc base address then get the `/bin/sh` & `system` address and get a shell ðŸ¤“

Here's my solve script [Exploit](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/picoctf/here's%20a%20libc/exploit.py)

Running it locally works

Also it works remotely

And we're done ðŸ‘»
