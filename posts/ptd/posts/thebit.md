Let start enumeration, starting with FTP

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(sec-fortressã‰¿kali)-[~/PTD/10.150.150.146]
â””â”€$ ftp 10.150.150.146

530 Login incorrect.

```

well never expected less, nmap told us so

We also found out that `port 80` is open which is HTTP, navigating to the website, we get this:

Nothing much even after `viewing-source`, Let perform a directory bruteforce with `gobuster`

```bash

- Navigating to /applications.html we have a random page//

![](https://i.imgur.com/1AFmzoA.png)

- Navigating to /dashboard, we get a 301 to /phpinfo.php giving us valuable able information about the web server, we are not meant to be able to view this page, you can know more form [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/194440/security-risks-of-having-public-phpinfo-page)

![](https://i.imgur.com/vlG9zp7.png)

- /Favicon.ico point to an image, nothing much there
- /img gives us an image directory with literally nothing

![](https://i.imgur.com/0jDS1or.png)

- /index.php leads us back to the default home page of the website
- /webalizer leads to a directory with nothing to

## Change of Plan

Going back to the website i clicked **`Get started`** and was referred to a /login page:

![](https://i.imgur.com/iKANPC7.png)

Nice ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‡

- [+] Tried default Credentials `admin:admin, admin:password` but none worked.
- [x] Going back to our nmap scan we found a suspicious service `3306/tcp open  mysql?`, then decided to try out SQL injection/
- [x] It worked with the query **`admin' OR 1'='1'--`** and we where presented with a dashboard 

![](https://i.imgur.com/KWTSVS9.png)

- Navigating to the `test bank`, we get FLAG3 and notice that the page is vulnerable to LFU (Local File Upload)

![](https://i.imgur.com/nFS4yao.png)


- We uploaded our shell and fuzz for where the file was stored using gobuster

```bash

- Nice, now we have our web shell

![](https://i.imgur.com/0T2EudA.png)

- Time to get a reverse shell

![](https://i.imgur.com/79uXKlU.png)

Now that we have our reverse shell, it is time to escalate priviledges and gain root

***checklist:**

- [ ] Any Kernel exploit 
- [ ] PATH Abuse
- [x] SUID
	- Below is how the exploit took place
