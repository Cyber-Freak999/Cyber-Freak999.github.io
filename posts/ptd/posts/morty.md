First of all, let run our nmap scan

```shell

Checking Port `80/HTTP` we have a note.html file, that says

```
Morty,  
if you read this: I've already configured your domain 'mortysserver.com' on this server, don't bother me with it anymore!!  
-Rick
```

Since we have been referred to **mortysserver.com** , we will add it to our `/etc/hosts` file , Navigating to **mortysserver.com** we have another website that seems like a password clue , `Fl4sk#!`

![](https://i.imgur.com/nsok2MH.png)


Viewing `Page-Source` we have a `screen.jpeg` file, we can download and analyze it to see if we can extract information from it

![](https://i.imgur.com/XdgAhmQ.png)

At first it doesn't seem like there is any embedded data, but using the password we got earlier to decrypt hidden information in the **screen.jpeg** file, we found a `TXT` file

![](https://i.imgur.com/kxDYKHf.png)

```shell
sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~/PTD/morty$ cat keytotheuniverse.txt 
rick:WubbaLubbaDubDub1!
```

The content of the file looks like a credential, Tried it for `SSH` but didn't work, We have port `53/DNS` opened, so we can do a zone transfer

Nice we have **rickscontrolpanel.mortysserver.com** subdomain, add it to your `/etc/hosts` file and Navigate to the website, In which we have a **PhpMyAdmin** page

![](https://i.imgur.com/QKIlf9M.png)

Trying out the credentials we found earlier , which is `rick:WubbaLubbaDubDub1!` , we got a successfully login ðŸ¤Ÿ , Also we found **FLAG2.txt** and we now know that the website uses **PhpMyAdmin Version - 4.8.1**

![](https://i.imgur.com/cxJOvWE.png)

Enumerating that version, we find an exploit, you can get it from [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50457) , Note that there is also a manual method to get shell

Since we can execute commands {RCE}, then definitely, we can send a `PHP` reverse shell to the target then load it up on our browser

![](https://i.imgur.com/OcxCIIT.png)

Now we can navigate to **/fuck.php** on the website, but first of all make sure you start your Netcat listener with the right IP Address and Port (Note: If you are not getting back a shell, Use Pentest Monkey payload, You can get it from [here](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php))

I tried to perform Privilege Escalation, But i don't think it is possible because we have found **FLAG3.txt** , which is located under the User **morty** home's directory
