We decided to run our nmap scan

```shell

Decided to enumerate port 8089/**Splunkd**, but we did not have any leads, enumerating Port 22/**SSH**, we have a username enumeration vulnerability, I tried several exploits but still no leads, But trying to connect to SSH without password gives us this banner :

Definitely we know `Mike` is the username, we can bruteforce the password using this [script](https://github.com/pwnesia/ssb) (I decided not to use **hydra** because it is too slow)

_Syntax :_

```shell
sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~/PTD/10.150.150.166$ sudo ssb -p 22 -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 15s -c 100 mike@10.150.150.166
```

_Output :_

Great!!!, Now we can login with the credentials `mike:babygirl`

### Privilege Escalation

Running `sudo -l` we have permissions to run all commands with sudo {This means we can do sudo followed by any other programs or binary with the password "**babygirl**" and it should give us user as "**root**"}.

This privilege escalation vector is as simple as running the command `sudo su` which means to switch user, since we don't have any user specified, it will automatically switch to the user **root** for us.

We got root!! bankai ðŸ˜‚
