Nice, we can see port 80 is open, let go check what we have there before our service and script scan is done‚ò¢Ô∏è

We have a jpeg, saying **mister Blue Sky** ü§î, guess you are thinking what i am thinking, well let view source, We have:

```html
<html>
<br>
<b><h1>Love This Song!!!<b></h1>
<br><br>
<img src="MrBlue.jpg" alt="Mr Blue aka MS17-010"></html>
```

the **alt** text looks like a vulnerability we have exploited sometime ago, let check it out:

Searching Google with the word **sp1, smb2** points to the Eternal Blue attack [...]

> Hmmmmm ü§î, what is the eternal blue attack ?
>  
> " EternalBlue is¬†**a Microsoft exploit which was used by the NSA in intelligence gathering operations** The exploit, officially named MS17-010 by Microsoft ‚Äî gave the US National Security Agency (NSA) backend access to devices running Windows operating systems like Windows XP and Windows 7 "

Well guess it is time to find a exploit, well i have one already so let roll ü§ü, you can set it up with these command :

```sh
root@kali:~# cd ~
root@kali:~# git clone https://github.com/d4t4s3c/Win7Blue.git
root@kali:~# cd Win7Blue
root@kali:~# chmod +x Win7Blue.sh
```

---

### Exploitation

**Note that from here on, you have the choice to use metasploit as these write-up does not cover the automatic use of metasploit, it is strictly manualüåö**

- First of all use `crackmapexec` to check for windows bit Version

```sh
root@kali:~# crackmapexec smb 10.150.150.242  
SMB         10.150.150.242  445    MRBLUE           [*] Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (name:MRBLUE) (domain:MrBlue) (signing:False) (SMBv1:True)
```

- Great, we can see our target is an **x64** bit system.
- You should have Win7Blue ready, so do **`./Win7Blue.sh`** on your terminal

- Since we know our target is vulnerable to eternal blue, we don't need to scan, so i will be selecting option 3
- But before that let start up our **netcat reverse shell**
	- Make sure to do **`sudo apt install rlwrap`** for shell stabilization
	- Now we are good ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Make sure to replace options respectively

- RHOST should be your target
- LHOST is your VPN IP address
- LPORT can be any, but port 445 will be better

**Our exploit is complete and we got shell as nt authority\system, we are definitely admin**
