We have ssh, nfs and http open 

Going over the web server shows the domain name

I added that to my `/etc/hosts` file

I'll see what mount is available on the nfs share

Cool there's a share which is accessible to everyone

I will mount it to my host

There's a public key hmmmm ðŸ¤”

For now we can't do anything with it so lets enumerate the web server

Goin over to the web server shows this page

The page is just a static page and the only button thats clickable is /portal

Going over there shows a login/signup page

Since i don't have any cred any default / weak cred doesn't work i'll signup

After logging in, it redirects to this page

If you notice the page it shows the user name we logged in as 

Checking the available cookie shows this session cookie

So this is a JWT token and you can tell cause it follows the pattern for JWT token which is `header.value.signature`

Using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) we see the jwt algorithm which is `RS256`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127159644/224587413-53993398-1740-41fe-9610-9322aedd9488.png)

After this i remembered that we got a public key value initially and from searching google i saw that you can likely perform `JWT Confusion Attack`

Here are the resource that helped me out
[Medium](https://nav7neeet.medium.com/jwt-key-confusion-attack-part1-556c2db4f148)
[Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/algorithm-confusion)
[Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-handle-jwt-in-python/)

Now the idea is that:

```
1. I'll change the algorithm from 'RS256' TO 'HS256'
2. Sign the new HS256 token
```

Initially i tried using jwt.io but i was having issue with it. So what i did then was to learn the way jwt can be used in python 

And i ended up scripting the signing of new signature using python
