Checking the web server shows this

Looking at the source code does not reveal much information

Remember that nmap showed there's a file in /robots.txt indexed

Checking it shows this

Going over there gives us access denied

Looking at the cookie shows it set to *denied*

Changing it to *granted* shows this

This looks like a cipher

```
Cipher: hEzAdCfHzA::hEzAdCfHzAhAiJzAeIaDjBcBhHgAzAfHfN 
```

At this point I was really confused on what to do i looked at the hint thm gave which was:

```
You're going to want to write a Python script for this. 'zA' = 'a'
```

This still doesn't makes sense to me ðŸ˜¥ I had to peek at a writeup for a better explanation on this i then understood it 

So basically:

```python
small alphabet, capital alphabet = alphabet that is at the position small alphabet + Capital alphabet 
```

For instance, 'z' is the 26th and 'A' is the 1st alphabet, and their sum is 27, and the '27th' alphabet (27 % 26 = 1) and the alphabet positioned there is 'a'.

I wrote a script to do the decoding
