Checking `FTP` we have a note for us, we can download it with the `mget` command

Checking the note, we can see that we have 3 usernames which is **Amy**, **holt** and **Jake** and it looks like Amy tells Jake to change his password because it is too weak 😂 (Great hint)

Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have this website

![](https://i.imgur.com/XLZtecj.png)


Viewing **Page-source** we have this commented text

![](https://i.imgur.com/qsJmKaz.png)

Navigating to `/brooklyn99.jpg` we truly have the image, we can download it with `wget` or just right click and **save**

![](https://i.imgur.com/nHk9snS.png)

Running a tool called `stegseek` on this image we found a `note.txt` file saved as `brooklyn99.jpg.out` on our system

```bash
$ sudo apt install stegseek
```

Concatenating `brooklyn99.jpg.out` looks like we found a new user called, **Holt's**, with his/her password

Running dir/file bruteforce with `dirsearch` nothing seems convincing (just to be sure we are doing the right thing 🐬)

![](https://i.imgur.com/cjs9a56.png)

we successfully logged in via `SSH` with the credentials we found, `holt:fluffydog12@ninenine`

![](https://i.imgur.com/hR2TUYq.png)

Navigating to `/var/www/html` we have a **photo.jpg** file

![](https://i.imgur.com/7fnluZV.png)


We can download it using `wget` again and run it through `stegseek`

As we can see we don't have much information than somoene's POC 😂

Running `sudo -l` we can see that we can run `/bin/nano` with the **sudo** command

![](https://i.imgur.com/CZZKJQ1.png)

Here is the command to get root with nano

```bash
$ sudo /bin/nano

# Ctrl+R - Ctrl+X
^R^X

$ reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```
