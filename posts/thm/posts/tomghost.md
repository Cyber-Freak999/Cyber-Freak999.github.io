Running our nmap scan we have this :

```bash

Running dir/file bruteforce we have series of entries

Checking all of these doesn't seem to give me good leads, Even tried logging in but we always have status code `404`

Enumerated harder and found [this](https://github.com/Hancheng-Lei/Hacking-Vulnerability-CVE-2020-1938-Ghostcat/blob/main/CVE-2020-1938.md) , we have a **Ghostcat-Apache Tomcat AJP File Read/Inclusion Vulnerability**

![](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/77/2c/ab/772cab4b3b0153ef4d7c46a00ee76b91.jpg)

Running the exploit we found a password and username

We can therefore login via `SSH`, since there is no where else to test the credential

On `/home/skyfuck` directory we have a `tryhackme.asc` file 

![](https://i.imgur.com/7qeSxPf.png)

We can transfer this file to our target machine with `netcat` and then attempt to crack it

![](https://i.imgur.com/5ksLrIU.png)

First of all convert this `.asc` to a crack-able hash that `johntheripper` can understand

![](https://i.imgur.com/6EjYWxm.png)

Then we can crack it with the following syntax

```bash
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

Next run the command on your target system -:

```bash
$ gpg --import tryhackme.asc
```

Then run this next and input the passphrase we got from `johntheripper` **(ale......)**

```bash
$ gpg --decrypt-files credential.pgp
```

**_Note :_**

Here are the two articles i used to go about solving the `.asc` and `.pgp` mystery

- [Link 1](https://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2015/11/17/1)
- [Link 2](https://superuser.com/questions/414679/how-to-extract-files-from-pgp-file)

Looks like we have user, **merlin** credential


![](https://i.imgur.com/hscZ38V.png)

Now switch user to **merlin**

Running `sudo -l` we have permissions to run `zip` with the `sudo` command


![](https://i.imgur.com/deRWpXl.png)

Using this payloads we got user, **root**

```bash
$ TF=$(mktemp -u)
$ sudo zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
```
