Running our nmap scan we have -:


```bash

We can't login to `FTP` as anonymous user

Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have a default Apache2 website



![](https://i.imgur.com/nGondix.png)


- No vital information on `Page-Source`
- status code `404` in both `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt`


Running dir/file bruteforce with `dirseach` we have only the `/assets` page


![](https://i.imgur.com/XT1GnQk.png)


Navigating to the `/assets` the first link truly got us **rick-rolled** üòÇ

![](https://i.imgur.com/EY5oCOM.png)

The second link, `/assets/style.css`, on the other hand gives us this information


![](https://i.imgur.com/YRKU9Of.png)


Checking `/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php` refers us to `/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g/` and then ask us to turn off **javascript**

![](https://i.imgur.com/EpMMxOe.png)

If you click `Ok` you get **rick-rolled** one more time üò≠üòÇ


![](https://i.imgur.com/3cJHyMG.png)

Making a request to `/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g/` with `curl` we can see we have a message, No wonder we are being referred ü§î


![](https://i.imgur.com/1W79sJq.png)

Well, start up `burpsuite` and intercept the `/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php` page then **send to repeater**

![](https://i.imgur.com/7rpCiII.png)


Click `Follow redirection` at the top-bar

![](https://i.imgur.com/KFz9j1T.png)



Nice, looks like this is what they don't want us to see, we are been referred to the page, `/intermediary.php?hidden_directory=/WExYY2Cv-qU`, then from here again to `http://10.10.184.53/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php`,
where the final **rick-roll** video plays

![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/d8/ca/5fd8ca9ef493ae16d1896d32a81cd193.gif)

Accessing `/intermediary.php?hidden_directory=/WExYY2Cv-qU` , i decided to use the **hidden_directory** parameter value directly, which is `/WExYY2Cv-qU`, we have an image

![](https://i.imgur.com/My70Hyn.png)

Download the image with the following command

```bash
$ wget http://10.10.184.53/WExYY2Cv-qU/Hot_Babe.png
```


Running the `strings` command on the image and scrolling down gives us this


![](https://i.imgur.com/qxi9ENY.png)


Running this command saves the passwords to a file called `passwd.txt`

```bash
$ strings Hot_Babe.png | tail -n 82 > passwd.txt
```

We can therefore bruteforce the `FTP` protocol with the following syntax using `hydra`

```bash
$ hydra -l ftpuser -P ./passwd.txt ftp://10.10.184.53 -V
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/wZKSAgI.png)

Login in with the username and password, `ftpuser:5iez1wGXKfPKQ` we have **Eli's_Creds.txt**


![](https://i.imgur.com/vNzuslp.png)

Download the file to your base machine with the `mget` command

![](https://i.imgur.com/fgr67EY.png)


Concatenating the `Eli's_Creds.txt` file gave us a brainfuck encoded text


![](https://i.imgur.com/cssdhQY.png)



Converting the brainfuck gave us **Eli's** credential

![](https://i.imgur.com/2AleGT7.png)

Login in via `SSH` we have a message from **root** to user **Gwendoline**


![](https://i.imgur.com/UkcTxv8.png)

running the `locate` command on the keyword **s3cr3t** we have

![](https://i.imgur.com/fRwgNc6.png)



Concatenating it gives us user **gwendoline** password

![](https://i.imgur.com/DFdLYhu.png)

switch user to **gwendoline**

```bash
$ su gwendoline
```

Running `sudo -l`, would i say we don't have permission to run `/usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt` as **root** üòÜ 


![](https://i.imgur.com/941ycmx.png)

After much lookups, using this payload we where able to view the file


```bash
$  sudo -u#-1 /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/Tb7Whlt.png)

we can therefore get a root shell by adding **semi-colon** (`:`) and then `!/bin/bash`

![](https://i.imgur.com/TVsf3qv.png)

Hell yeah, we are root
