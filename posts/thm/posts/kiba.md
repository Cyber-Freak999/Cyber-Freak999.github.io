Port `80/HTTP` doesn't seem to give me what i want, even while performing **directory bruteforcing**, No directory/files where discovered

Port `5044` isn't loading up, but port `5601` gives us a **Kibana** Dashboard page

Nice, we can navigate to the **Management** menu to see which version of kibana we are using, these will give us the chance to enumerate more:

>Cool, we have a **Prototype Pollution** vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit the rules of the JavaScript programming language, by injecting properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as Objects to compromise applications in various ways. This could literally lead to **RCE**

Navigate to the **Timelion** menu and follow this [guide](https://github.com/mpgn/CVE-2019-7609) to know more about how the **RCE** took place

### Privilege Escalation

Running `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` in other to check for files with Capabilities we can see that a python binary has been stored on the user **Kiba's** home directory, we can use this to get `root`

![](https://i.imgur.com/D6eCjOA.png)

Using this payload we can get elevated privileges as `root` üêâ

```shell
/home/kiba/.hackmeplease/python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```
