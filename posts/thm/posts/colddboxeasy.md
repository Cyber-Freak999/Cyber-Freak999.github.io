Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have a word press website

Running a word press scanner called `wpscan` , i was able to find some valid usernames we can try to bruteforce under `/wp-login.php`

```bash
$ wpscan --url http://10.10.44.62/ -e u,cb --verbose
```

Nice, so we have **hugo**, **c0ldd** and **philip**, we can also navigate to `/wp-login.php` and try out this usernames with the wrong password to confirm if it is true

We can therefore save this username into a text file and bruteforce with `wpscan`

```bash
$ wpscan --url http://10.10.44.62/ -U users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

We found only one user password which is user **c0ldd**

We can therefore upload our shell by changing the content of the plugin files and navigating to the URL

**The URL :**

We got our shell back as user **www-data**

Navigating to the `/var/www/html` directory we have the **wp-config.php** file

![](https://i.imgur.com/WIXO1zB.png)

concatenating it gives us user **c0ldd** password

![](https://i.imgur.com/rlfKv5g.png)

we can therefore `su` to user **c0ldd**

Running `sudo -l` we see that we have the permission to run vim, chmod and ftp with super user permissions

![](https://i.imgur.com/2zFVR5e.png)

i will be using `/usr/bin/vim` to gain root, on the command line do

```bash
$ sudo /usr/bin/vim
```

Hit enter and You should then be given a prompt like this

Then just type in `:shell` and you should be root
