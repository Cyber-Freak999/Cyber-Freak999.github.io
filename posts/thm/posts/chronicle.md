Checking the web instance on port 80 shows this

It shows another directory called /old checking it shows a note.txt file

I'll fuzz for things there again

We can see 200 http code status for */.git/HEAD*

Lets confirm it

Boom we have an exposed .git on the web server

Using *git-dumper* I'll dump its content committed ðŸ™‚

Looking at the cwd we can see *note.txt*

Checking the git logs gives this

```
Command: git log
```

Looking through commit one shows the css of the web app

While for commit two shows the web app source code

And remember that there's another web server running on port 8081 so likely this is the source code since nmap showed that its based off a python web server

Moving over to port 8081 shows this
