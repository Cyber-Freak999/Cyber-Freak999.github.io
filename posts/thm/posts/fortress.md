Lets start enumeration from ftp

Reading the *marked.txt* file shows this

While checking the file type for the *file* shows it's a python compiled binary

Lets decompile it using [uncompyle2](https://github.com/wibiti/uncompyle2)

We can see what it does. It creates a socket running on port *5752* and it asks for username and password, If the provided username and password is correct it calls the secret() function which basically opens up the *secret.txt* file

But the username and password is converted from bytes to long I wrote a script to decode it

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# Author: Hack.You
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

usern = 232340432076717036154994
passw = 10555160959732308261529999676324629831532648692669445488

print(f'Username: {long_to_bytes(usern)}')
print(f'Password: {long_to_bytes(passw)}')
```

Running the script gives the username and password

Now lets connect to the remote socket hosted on port 5752

It gives us this `t3mple_0f_y0ur_51n5`

What can we do with this now ðŸ¤”

Lets move over to the web server 

Checking it just shows the normal apache default web page
