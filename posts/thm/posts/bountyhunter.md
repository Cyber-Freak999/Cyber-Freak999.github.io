Running our nmap scan we have :

```powershell

## **FTP Enumeration**

- Nmap already told us we have two files here so we can download them with the following command :

```powershell
$ wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.10.163.201
```


- We can then Navigate to the `10.10.163.201` Folder, to enumerate further.

- We have a task from `lin` and some kind of wordlist from `locks.txt` , we can try bruteforcing these

## **Foot Hold**

We where able to bruteforce the password of  `lin` with the given `locks.txt`

We can then login and get our shell as `lin` and get the flag in the `user.txt` file.

## **Privilege Escalation**

The first thing i do if i get a user that isn't `www-data` is run `sudo -l` to show what commands i can run with **sudo** privileges

- Over here we can run `sudo -l` and as we can see we have permissions to run `/bin/tar`
- That is we can get root using `/bin/tar`

- Nice, So, using the payload as shown below, you should be root ðŸ¤—

```powershell
$ sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
```
